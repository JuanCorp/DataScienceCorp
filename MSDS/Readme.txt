This  folder is for things that I did while taking the Microsoft Data Science course curriculum.
Unfortunately, most things are either on experiments that are on the AzureML cloud, or oneshot scripts
and code snippets that I created on other courses. I'll post the notebook I did for analysis here, as well as links to any AzureML experiment or WebService that I create.
